knklib is a silly little program that allows querying the KANKA "artificial intelligence" of MEBÄ° (MEB Individual Learning Platform).

From what it seems, KANKA is far from anything that can be considered "artificial intelligence"; it looks more like a simple sentence matching program. It's useless, but its uselessness is fun to play with.

The only dependencies (other than Lua) are lua-cjson (https://luarocks.org/modules/openresty/lua-cjson) and lua-http (https://github.com/daurnimator/lua-http).

There is no proper documentation; see the source code instead. It is short and straightforward.
